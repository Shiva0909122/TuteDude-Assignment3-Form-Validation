# TuteDude-Assignment3-Form-Validation

Problem Statement:  This JavaScript and jQuery project aims to create a robust Form Validation application. Users will enter details into a form, and upon clicking the submission button, the application will validate all input fields. Any errors will be listed clearly, ensuring a fresh error list with each submission. If all fields are correctly validated, a success message will be displayed. This project ensures accurate data entry and enhances user experience by providing immediate and clear feedback.
